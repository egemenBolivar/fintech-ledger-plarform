# FinTech Wallet & Ledger Platform

A **production-inspired FinTech backend & frontend system**
built to demonstrate **real-world financial architecture** —
not a simple CRUD application.

This project focuses on:
- Immutable ledger design
- Multi-currency wallet systems
- Modular monolith architecture
- Scalable Angular frontend
- Cloud-ready deployment & observability

> Designed as a **portfolio-grade FinTech system**, inspired by
> modern banking and payment platforms.

## 🚀 Why This Project Exists

Most demo projects stop at:
> “User adds money, balance updates.”

This project answers:
- How do **real financial systems track money?**
- How are balances **derived**, not mutated?
- How do systems evolve from **monolith → microservices**?

---

## 🧠 Key Highlights

✅ Derived balances (no fake updates)  
✅ Modular Monolith with DDD boundaries  
✅ Angular feature-based UI  
✅ CI/CD & cloud tooling ready  
✅ Observability-first mindset
